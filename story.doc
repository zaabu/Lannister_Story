This is my story

Weâ€™re all storytellers.

But, what is a story? And where does it come from?

Before we attempt to define story and its origin, I want to make one thing very clear. 
As storytellers, as purveyors of yarns that are intended to entertain, educate, inspire or intrigue, 
we have to be aware that our yarns can assume several different forms.

Like shape-shifters, our stories can morph themselves into a variety of configurations depending 
on the nature of the story, the intended recipients and the circumstances. Some possible shapes: 
novel, short story, poem, play, film, memoir, oral, audio, visual, etc. You get the idea.


Simon's Story 
Stretching may not be the most exciting part of working out,
but doing flexibility work is just as important for a well-rounded 
fitness routine as strength and cardio work.
Incorporating some stretching exercises into your workout schedule will help you improve flexibility, 
reduce tightness, and ultimately, 
make your workouts more efficient and safe.

There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, 
or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.
