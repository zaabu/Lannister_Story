This is my story

Weâ€™re all storytellers.

But, what is a story? And where does it come from?

Before we attempt to define story and its origin, I want to make one thing very clear. 
As storytellers, as purveyors of yarns that are intended to entertain, educate, inspire or intrigue, 
we have to be aware that our yarns can assume several different forms.

Like shape-shifters, our stories can morph themselves into a variety of configurations depending 
on the nature of the story, the intended recipients and the circumstances. Some possible shapes: 
novel, short story, poem, play, film, memoir, oral, audio, visual, etc. You get the idea.
