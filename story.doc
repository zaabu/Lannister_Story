Passion
Passion is having high interest and love for something. I believe that if am to solve problems with technology I have to love and have interest for technology and software development. I believe that when I have passion for my job I will be motivated to put in more effort and not give up easily when I face challenges. 
For example if i joined andela because it’s the only job that i could find  but not because of my love for software development, I will not be able to deliver as expected and I will easily give up when I face challenges.

This is my story

We’re all storytellers.

But, what is a story? And where does it come from?

Before we attempt to define story and its origin, I want to make one thing very clear. 
As storytellers, as purveyors of yarns that are intended to entertain, educate, inspire or intrigue, 
we have to be aware that our yarns can assume several different forms.

Like shape-shifters, our stories can morph themselves into a variety of configurations depending 
on the nature of the story, the intended recipients and the circumstances. Some possible shapes: 
novel, short story, poem, play, film, memoir, oral, audio, visual, etc. You get the idea.


Simon's Story 
Stretching may not be the most exciting part of working out,
but doing flexibility work is just as important for a well-rounded 
fitness routine as strength and cardio work.
Incorporating some stretching exercises into your workout schedule will help you improve flexibility, 
reduce tightness, and ultimately, 
make your workouts more efficient and safe.
