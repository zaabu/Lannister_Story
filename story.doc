Simon's Story 
Stretching may not be the most exciting part of working out,
but doing flexibility work is just as important for a well-rounded 
fitness routine as strength and cardio work.
Incorporating some stretching exercises into your workout schedule will help you improve flexibility, 
reduce tightness, and ultimately, 
make your workouts more efficient and safe.
