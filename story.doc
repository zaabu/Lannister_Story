Passion
Passion is having high interest and love for something. I believe that if am to solve problems with technology I have to love and have interest for technology and software development. I believe that when I have passion for my job I will be motivated to put in more effort and not give up easily when I face challenges. 
For example if i joined andela because itâ€™s the only job that i could find  but not because of my love for software development, I will not be able to deliver as expected and I will easily give up when I face challenges.
